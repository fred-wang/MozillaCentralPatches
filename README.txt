The set of patches for mozilla-central I'm currently working on are given in the
status file and should be applied in the order they are listed. However, the
patches mathparser-*.diff are only used for the Mathzilla project and are not
expected to be submitted to trunk. You probably do not want to apply them, but
you can still find them in the separate Mathzilla repository. Other files listed
in the series file are old or experimental patches which are not necessarily
maintained and which are not supposed to be currently used.
