A set of work-in-progress patches for mozilla-central.

See http://www.wg9s.com/mozilla/firefox/

The file WG9s_patchlist contains the patches in the order to apply them to duplicate these builds, omitting those patches that are not really check-in ready that I include only to resolve my own build issues.
